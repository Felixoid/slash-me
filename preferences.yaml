Advantages:
  - Strong desire to get rid of unnecessary work
  - Eagerness to learn new things
  - My job is my hobby too

Disadvantages:
  - It's very hard for me to do boring tasks. More probably I'll find a way how to get rid of the task. E.g:
    - Instead of washing floors: buy a robo-washer
    - Instead of redeploying to decrease VMs disks: implement a feature to decrease disks on the fly
  - Extra tension to automate things
  - I like to discuss. I guess it's the best way to find a perfect solution, but people who don't know me may dislike the approach.
