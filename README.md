It's a me

## CVs
The actual CVs for different positions are the releases' assets, [static link](https://github.com/Felixoid/slash-me/releases)

Additionally, you can take a look into my [open-source](./opensource.yaml) history and [biography](biography.yaml).

## Usage
To build a CV, run `make 'position name'`

### Requirements
Install `texlive-most` on Arch Linux to get all necessary texlive packages.
